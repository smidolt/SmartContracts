#### Program 1: AucEngine.sol

This Solidity smart contract facilitates auctions for various items, allowing users to create and participate in auctions with specific starting prices, durations, and discount rates. The platform owner receives a fee from successful auction transactions.

#### Program 2: FullyPaidRealisation.sol

This Solidity smart contract manages transactions between buyers and a shop, allowing the owner to add buyers and withdraw funds once transactions are fully paid. Buyers can purchase items from the shop, and the contract ensures proper payment handling.

#### Program 3: Merkletree.sol

This Solidity smart contract constructs a Merkle tree from a series of transactions and provides methods to verify transaction inclusion using Merkle proofs. It encodes and hashes transactions to build a secure data structure for transaction history.
